## Reflection

### Challenges with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Challenge 1**: Setting up proper VPC networking and security groups
- **Solution**: Used AWS documentation and modular Terraform approach

- **Challenge 2**: Managing Terraform state and variables
- **Solution**: Implemented proper variable definitions and outputs

### Manual Deployment Process Challenges
- **Challenge 1**: Building and pushing Docker images to ECR
- **Solution**: Set up proper AWS CLI authentication and ECR login

- **Challenge 2**: Configuring container service to connect to RDS
- **Solution**: Used environment variables and security group rules

### Key Learnings
1. **IaC Benefits**: Reproducible infrastructure, version control for infrastructure
2. **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds significantly reduce image size
3. **Cloud Integration**: Importance of proper networking and security configurations
4. **Manual vs Automated**: Manual deployment helps understand the process before automation

### Future Improvements
- Implement automated deployment pipeline (Phase 3)
- Add monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Optimize container images further
- Implement secrets management
